Welcome to **HeartAttackPrediction**—where data science meets life-or-death stakes! 🌩️ We’re cracking the code on heart attacks in the USA, mixing health stats, lifestyle vibes, and ML magic. Can you predict a ticker’s fate? Stick around—this ride’s pumping! 🚀

## The Mission 🎯
Picture this: 32 clues—like `Age` 👴, `Cholesterol` 🍔, `Smoker` 🚬, even `StressLevel` 😰—all whispering secrets about whether someone’s heart goes *"Boom!"* or *"All good!"*. Our target? The `Outcome`: *"Heart Attack"* or *"No Heart Attack"*. We’re building a Flask-powered crystal ball 🔮, fueled by Python, MLflow, and DVC, to spot risks and save the day.

## What’s Cooking? 🔥
- **Data**: A juicy stash of 32 features—blood pressure to booze, chest pain to chill levels. It’s raw, real, and ready! 📊
- **Tools**:
  - **Python** 🐍: Pandas and Scikit-learn for the heavy lifting.
  - **Flask** 🍶: A slick web app to serve predictions with swagger.
  - **MLflow** 📈: Tracking every experiment like a detective’s notebook.
  - **DVC + DagsHub** 🗂️: Versioning data and models—Git for the big stuff.
  - **GitHub** 🌐: Where the code lives, breathes, and grows.
